DeLorean is a Zsh configuration framework built for speed and ease of use.

See the benefits, compared to other popular frameworks, at the [Framework
Comparison][] page.

## Flux capacitor

DeLorean sequences the circuits configured in [`flux-capacitor.zsh`][].

Most configurations are self-explanatory or documented at the corresponding
circuit repository.

## Circuits

DeLorean comes with a [core set of circuits][], primarily ported over from
[sorin-ionescu/prezto][].

Less common circuits are also available, and may be found at the [DeLorean
Circuits][] page.

To share a circuit you've created, please add it to the [Community Circuits][]
page.

## FPATH blacklist

The `$fpath` blacklist is core to DeLorean, and allows for non-destructive
optimization of Zsh.
